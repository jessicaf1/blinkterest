- when i changed jbuilder it wouldnt  let me access currentUser.email,
but it also won't let me change state in navBarcontainer (added json.user do/end around it). can't figure out
how to split email on the @sign, tried it in both model level and in navb component 
- routes - why is edit container not loading
- not sure how fname, lname, etc, figure into state 

questions for the weekend:

pin belongs to one specific user? is it current user??
do i make boards-pins simultaneously? not totally sure how that factors in 
so - 

pin is not connected to user but pin has many boards thru user?

ASSOCIATIONS: 
board belongs to user
pin belongs to user 

user has many boards, user has many pins

THROUGH ASSOCATIONS:
pin has many boards thru user?

AWS q's:


has_one_attached_photo in posts is talking about which component for me?

pin doesnt have user Id
linkURL optional 

both has_many/no belongs_to 

instance of board-pin belongs to pin and to board 

board has many board-pins and pin has many board-pins 
board has many pins thru board-pins 

need board show 
need to modify userjbuilder to have board IDs/write assocation from users - board-pins, belongs to pin 

pinning a pin to a board - adds an entry to the b-p tale 
pins controller 



controllers/jbuilder 


- 

check Jbuilders esp user/pin

to do - 
home button 
redirect from saving a pin 
style padding
