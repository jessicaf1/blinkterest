- when i changed jbuilder it wouldnt  let me access currentUser.email,
but it also won't let me change state in navBarcontainer (added json.user do/end around it). can't figure out
how to split email on the @sign, tried it in both model level and in navb component 
- routes - why is edit container not loading
- not sure how fname, lname, etc, figure into state
